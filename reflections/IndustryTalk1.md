The PPG Industry Talk is to understand how a global leader integrates technology with business strategy to "protect and beautify the world". I learned that IT is a strategic enabler rather than just a support function, demonstrated by PPG’s "Plan, Build, Run" model and the "Connect PPG" SAP S/4HANA transformation aimed at creating a connected, agile, and scalable enterprise. The talk highlighted the importance of pragmatism through a Multi-Cloud approach—leveraging AWS, Azure, Oracle, and Alibaba—to ensure the best fit for specific regional needs and compliance. Most importantly, it clarified that future success in the industry requires a critical mindset shift from simply writing code to solving complex business problems using tools like Python, SQL, and Big Data solutions.
