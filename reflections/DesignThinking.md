Through this Design Thinking project, our team transformed the campus bus experience from a source of high anxiety into a structured, user-centric solution by focusing on information transparency. By analyzing data from 31 respondents, we discovered that 100% of students felt stressed and helpless due to unpredictable schedules, which led us to prioritize features like real-time GPS tracking and emergency SOS buttons to address both efficiency and personal safety. The iterative process of mapping user flows and testing digital wireframes taught us that effective design isn't just about technical functionality, but about actively listening to user feedback, such as the need for push notifications to create a truly seamless journey. Ultimately, this collaboration highlighted that successful problem-solving requires a balance of empathy, data-driven decision-making, and clear team communication to turn user frustrations into a functional, secure application system.
