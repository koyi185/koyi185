Attending the industry talk by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim was an eye-opening experience because he shared the importance of transitioning from "exam-mode" memorization to a deep, practical understanding of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and project management. The talk clarified how methodologies like Waterfall and Agile are used to "control chaos" in real-world projects, while also stressing that technical skills must be paired with strong communication to bridge the gap between engineering and design. Perhaps most importantly, the speaker and students alike reflected on the role of AI, concluding that it is a helpful tool and it should never replace the fundamental problem-solving skills and continuous learning habits essential for a successful career in technology.
