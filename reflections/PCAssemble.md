The PC Assembly Lab was a hands-on experience that deeply enhanced my understanding of computer hardware architecture. Besides just identifying components like the motherboard, power supply, and cooling systems, the core challenge lay in the disciplined process of disassembling the unit step-by-step and then reversing the entire sequence to rebuild it. This task required immense attention to detail, especially in cable management and ensuring every connector was securely seated. The most rewarding moment was the "power-on test" after reassembly. Successfully booting the machine proved that I had not only understood the physical structure but also mastered the logical precision required in hardware maintenance. This lab reinforced the importance of methodical troubleshooting and gave me the confidence to handle complex hardware systems in the future.
