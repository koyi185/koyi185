The industrial visit to Johor Port Berhad was a really eyes-opening experience which is leading us to know more about the global logistics. Beyond just seeing heavy machinery, we discovered how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) serves as the "nervous system" of the port, moving from a mere support role to a vital strategic enabler. It was fascinating to see how their four pillars—Infrastructure, Business Application, Project & Governance, and Helpdesk—work in harmony to ensure seamless 24/7 operations. This experience underscored that the future of the industry isn't just about moving cargo, but about managing data with precision, standardizing global processes through systems like SAP, and maintaining an unwavering commitment to cybersecurity. We left with a renewed understanding that our growth as tech professionals depends on our ability to solve complex business problems and adapt to the rapid digitalization of the maritime world.
